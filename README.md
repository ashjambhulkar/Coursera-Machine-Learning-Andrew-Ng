This are My solutions to Programming exercises from Machine Learning - Stanford University by Andrew Ng. If you are taking the class please use your own logic
, DO NOT refer any code before solving or submitting any programming exercise from this repo.

Please DO NOT post any code in my exercises and violate the Stanford Honor Code.

#Stanford Honor Code

"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
